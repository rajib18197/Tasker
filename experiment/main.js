// Little bit of gratification
// Can't praise enough of how much your explanations from docs is beneficial for me. I can retain more knowledge than before as I am listening to your explanations as well as then reading the docs later. (Listening + Reading) for the same information enhances my memory power significantly which has surprised me and practice takes it even the next level.

// Genuinely admire and appreciate for this unique blend of touch you have added in the course.
